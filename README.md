# Timeseries-Analysis-of-Tempreature

Goal of the project is to Generate a short-term temperature forecast of Berlin Tempelhof, Berlin

The data is taken from www.ecad.eu and is available in the file TG_STAID002759.txt

The jupyter notebook attached here analyse the data first. Required cleaning and initial analysis of the data is done. Time series components are studied here in details. A baseline model is done to find trend and seasonality. The "remainder" is analysed throughly. Modelling the time dependence of the remainder using different AutoRegressive models are done. Finally modelling is done on the data and forecast of temperature  is made for 1st January 2023.
